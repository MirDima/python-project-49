### Dependencies:

* python = "3.9^"
* prompt = "0.4.1^"

### Description:

**"Mind Games"** is a set of five console games based on the popular mobile brain-pumping apps. Each game asks questions that need to be answered correctly. After three correct answers, the game is considered completed. Incorrect answers end the game and prompt you to play it again. 

Games:

### $\color{Cerulean}{test}$

* __Brain Even__ (Answer "yes" if the number is even, otherwise answer "no")
* __<g>Brain Calculator__ (Answer what is the result of the expression?)
* __Brain GCD__ (Answer what is the greatest common divisor of given numbers)
* __Brain Progression__ (Answer what number is missing in the progression?)
* __Brain Prime__ (Answer "yes" if given number is prime, otherwise answer "no")

They are launched with simple commands:*
```commandline
brain-even
brain-calc
brain-gcd
brain-progression
brain-prime
```
:pencil2:*_Make sure that you have Python version 3.6 or higher installed._

### Brain even
The idea of the game: the user is shown a random number. 
And he should answer **yes** if the number is even, or **no** if it is odd:
