### Dependencies:

* python = "3.9^"
* prompt = "0.4.1^"

### Description:

**"Mind Games"** is a set of five console games based on the popular mobile brain-pumping apps. Each game asks questions that need to be answered correctly. After three correct answers, the game is considered completed. Incorrect answers end the game and prompt you to play it again. 

Games:

* __Brain Even__ (Answer __"yes"__ if the number is even, otherwise answer __"no"__)
* __<g>Brain Calculator__ (Answer what is the result of the expression?)
* __Brain GCD__ (Answer what is the greatest common divisor of given numbers)
* __Brain Progression__ (Answer what number is missing in the progression?)
* __Brain Prime__ (Answer "yes" if given number is prime, otherwise answer "no")

They are launched with simple commands:*
```commandline
brain-even
brain-calc
brain-gcd
brain-progression
brain-prime
```
:pencil2:*_Make sure that you have Python version 3.6 or higher installed._

### Demo:
<hr>

### Brain even ðŸ•¹
The idea of the game: the user is shown a random number. 
And he should answer **yes** if the number is even, or **no** if it is odd:

### Brain calculator ðŸ•¹
The user is shown a random mathematical expression, such as 35 + 16, which must be calculated and write down the correct answer.

### Brain GCD ðŸ•¹
The user is shown two random numbers, for example 25 and 50. The user must calculate and enter the greatest common divisor of these numbers.

### Brain progression ðŸ•¹
The user is shown a series of numbers with a missing number, forming an arithmetic progression. The player has to determine this number.

### Brain prime ðŸ•¹
The user is shown a random number. And he needs to answer yes if the number is prime, or no if it is composite:
